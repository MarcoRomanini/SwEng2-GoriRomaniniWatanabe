% ############ 5.2) INTEGRATION PLAN ########################

In this section, we describe how the components are integrated in order to build the S2B. The integration is divided into different phases.
\newline

First of all, the first components to build are the microservices, since they are the core of the system. It is possible to prioritize the integration of the most critical services at first, and later on add the other services.
\newline

After this, the API gateway and the Event BUS are the next things to add. The Event BUS will implement all the design patterns related to database communication between microservices, in order to guarantee a correct transmission of information. The API gateway, on the other end, will assure the correct invocation of the methods and functionalities of the microservices.
\newline

At this point, it is possible to integrate the authorization server, connected to the API gateway, that will handle all the security aspects, especially those related to authentication and authorization. 
\newline

Then, it is time to integrate the external APIs and Databases. Since we are assuming them as given and already implemented, we just need to correctly connect them with the rest of the system.
\newline

Finally, it is possible to integrate the mobile application module and the web application module, together with the web browser, that will handle the user-side aspects of the S2B.
