\hyperref[tab:acronymsTable]{DREAM} is an easy-to-use application which intent is [cite assignment] to design dynamic anticipatory governance models for food systems using digital public goods and community-centric approaches to strengthen data-driven policy making in the region of Telangana, India.

The region's main means of livelihood indeed heavily relies on agriculture, typically/widely represented by smallholders farmers' activities. These ones are easily affected by complex problems such as climate change and the incoming raise of food demand due to the continuous population increase. In addition to that, the occurrence of Covid-19 pandemic is recently causing further obstacles (such as food supply chains disruption) to the achievement of a resilient food system.

The final aim of the Telengana's government is collecting and analyzing agriculture related real-time conditions in order to monitor and support smallholder's activities resilience capacity against the above mentioned problems.

\subsection{Purpose}
The main purpose of the \hyperref[tab:acronymsTable]{S2B} is acting as a bridge between the main actors of the food systems: \textbf{policy makers}, \textbf{farmers} and \textbf{agronomists}. This can be achieved through the development of a multi-user unified platform that allows actors to share data. In particular the system should guarantee the following privileges and functionalities based on the user identity; we present them in the following list, extracted from the original assignment.
\begin{description}[font=~\normalfont\scshape]
    \item[\textbf{\textcolor{myblue}{Policy makers privileges}}]\label{line:policyMakersPrivileges}
    \hfill \begin{enumerate}[topsep=0pt,leftmargin=0pt]
                \item Identify those farmers who are performing well, especially when they demonstrate to be resilient to meteorological adverse events, as these farmers will receive special incentives and will be asked to provide useful best practices to the others;
                \item Identify those farmers who need to be helped as they are performing particularly badly;
                \item Understand whether the steering initiatives carried out by agronomists with the help of good farmers produce significant results.
            \end{enumerate}
    \item[\textbf{\textcolor{myblue}{Farmers privileges}}]\label{line:farmersPrivileges}
    \hfill \begin{enumerate}[topsep=0pt,leftmargin=0pt, resume]
                \item Visualize data relevant to them –-- for instance, weather forecasts, personalized suggestions concerning specific crops to plant or specific fertilizers to use --– based on their location and type of production;
                \item Insert in the system data about their production and any problem they face;
                \item Request for help and suggestions by agronomists and other farmers;
                \item Create discussion forums with the other farmers.
            \end{enumerate}
    \item[\textbf{\textcolor{myblue}{Agronomist privileges}}]\label{line:agronomistPrivileges}
    \hfill \begin{enumerate}[topsep=0pt,leftmargin=0pt, resume]
                \item Insert the area they are responsible of;
                \item Receive information about requests for help and answer to these requests;
                \item Visualize data concerning weather forecasts in the area and the best performing farmers in the area;
                \item Visualize and update a daily plan to visit farms in the area, assuming that all farms must be visited at least twice a year, but those that are under-performing should be visited more often, depending on the type of problem they are facing;
                \item Confirm the execution of the daily plan at the end of each day or specify the deviations from the plan.
            \end{enumerate}
\end{description}


\textbf{Aggiungere che si assume che i policy maker siano responsabili di inviare incentivi}


Furthermore the system should make use of the already collected data such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Data concerning meteorological short-term and long-term forecasts;
    \item Information obtained by the water irrigation system concerning the amount of water used by each farmer;
    \item Information obtained by sensors deployed on the territory and measuring the humidity of soil.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Scope}
\label{sec:scope}
The environment in which the platform will be involved will be the whole region of Telangana. Policy makers, farmers and agronomist will have the possibility to access the system through their personal devices. Furthermore the devices responsible for the gathering of information such as the ones of the water irrigation system, the humidity sensors are supposed to be shared along the territory in a ditributed system fashion.

\subsubsection{World Phenomena}
%what you write here is a comment that is not shown in the final text
In this section are introduced the environment related phenomena that the S2B is supposed to face. As described in \cite{jackson_twatm}, for each phenomenon we specifiy if it is shared and the system that can control it.

\subsection{Goals}
According to \cite{jackson_dsfr} (revised) it's stakeholders' prerogative to determine the goals: thus in this section, in order to introduce some sort of atomicity of the goals, we derive a list of formal description of them from the requested functionalities presented in section \ref{sec:scope}. Furthermore in order to justify the definition of each goal, we also map each of them to the related assignment exctract.

\subsection{Definitions, Acronyms, Abbreviations}
In order to introduce some sort of coherence in an environment--- the physical world--- that is informal, we present in this section the sets of \textbf{definitions}, \textbf{acronyms} and \textbf{abbreviations} used in the following sections. These are supposed to be as more generic as possible, in order to provide more flexibility for the following phases of the Waterfall software lifecycle.


\textbf{It is important to agree in advance on the specific keywords and terms that signal the presence of specific entity. Following the convention defined in \cite{iso_ieee_standard} we therefore adopt the following terms to identify and describe requirements, goals and domain assumptions.}

%# SOURCE : https://reqexperts.com/2012/10/09/using-the-correct-terms-shall-will-should/
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Shall}: Shall is used to indicate a requirement that is contractually binding, meaning it must be implemented, and its implementation verified.  Period!  Don’t think of “shall” as a word, but rather as an icon that SCREAMS: “This is a requirement.”  If a statement does not contain the word “shall” it is not a requirement.
    \item \textbf{Will}: Will is used to indicate a domain assumption.  Will statements are not subject to verification.
    \textbf{Should}: Should is used to indicate a goal which must be addressed by the design team but is not formally verified.
\end{itemize}

        \textsc{Production Data}     &   All general kind of information that describes what the farmer with his activity produces. In order to achieve some form of coherence and uniformity for this kind of information, we consider useful to let the farmer describe it by a set of mandatory properties that are analogous to each product (e.g. type of product, amount of produced items, unit of measurement etc.). In order to achieve a deeper level of understanding we consider useful to let the user the possibility to fill some optional fields like a qualitative descriprion of the produced items or notes relevant for the other users of the system \\
        \hline
        \textsc{Problem information}  &   Every kind of information that describes in a functional way the general set of events that [could get in the way of/represent an obstacle to] farmer's ordinary production rate \\

        \textsc{Help request}     &   The Farmer activity of information retrieval. The farmer should be able to request information in a private way to the other components of the systems, like other farmers and/or agronomists, in order to increase the quality of their activity \\
