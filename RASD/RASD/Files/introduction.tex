% This document has been prepared to help you approaching Latex as a formatting tool for your Travlendar+ deliverables. This document suggests you a possible style and format for your deliverables and contains information about basic formatting commands in Latex. A good guide to Latex is available here \href{https://tobi.oetiker.ch/lshort/lshort.pdf}{https://tobi.oetiker.ch/lshort/lshort.pdf}, but you can find many other good references on the web. 

% Writing in Latex means writing textual files having a \texttt{.tex} extension and exploiting the Latex markup commands for formatting purposes. Your files then need to be compiled using the Latex compiler. Similarly to programming languages, you can find many editors that help you writing and compiling your latex code. Here \href{https://beebom.com/best-latex-editors/}{https://beebom.com/best-latex-editors/} you have a short oviewview of some of them. Feel free to choose the one you like.  

% Include a subsection for each of the following items\footnote{By the way, what follows is the structure of an itemized list in Latex.}:
